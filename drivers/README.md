!!! Important !!!

Just to have a lean project on Git, I have decided not to include the CMSIS repo and HAL drivers repositories, which are part of this directory.

Clone them and set relevants include paths in the CMakeLists.txt in the root folder.

One can include by cloning them from,

CMSIS : https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/cmsis-core/tree/master

HAL Drivers : https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32f4xx-hal-driver
